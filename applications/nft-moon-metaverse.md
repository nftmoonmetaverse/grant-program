### Overview

 NFT Moon Metaverse is the futuristic Create2Earn multi blockchain universe. It will be inhabited by self-driven and creative people craving for boundless opportunities. NFT Moon is a metaverse in which a person can build a new life. The main task of the player is to make the planet alive. To do this, convenient constructors are given, where a person builds avatars, houses, objects, cities, countries. All interaction is based on Play2Earn and Create2Earn. The entire metaverse is built on plots of land. Plots can already be bought . The plot gives the following opportunities: to divide the land, to rent, to receive income from the metaverse, access to advanced designer features, access to rare avatars.
ID Cards grants the entrance to the Metaverse where each person can build a personalized reality and experience. Besides networking with other MoonWalkers , one has access to a variety of Metaverse assets: land plots, objects, avatars, advanced designer features. There are over 10 beneficial opportunities in NFT Moon Metaverse — from renting land to creating businesses and events.

We are interested in expanding the blockchains that will be used in the metaverse. Now we use four main blockchains: Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche.
Thanks to the bridge between blockchains, we will implement a bridge for the VeChain blockchain. This will make it possible to move assets of the metaverse (land, ID card, avatars) from other blockchains to the VeChain network and in the opposite direction.
It will also enable holders of land, id cards, avatars to trade them on marketplaces that support VeChain:

 - [World of V](https://marketplace.worldofv.art/)
  - [VeSea](https://vesea.io/)
  - [VPunks](https://vpunks.com/#/)
  - [VimWorld](https://www.vimworld.com/vimmarket)
  - [NFT Paper Project](https://nftpaperproject.com/market)
  - [BlackVeMarket](https://blackvemarket.com/)


Thus, we will create a trading path between different blockchains for NFT Moon Metaverse. 
Example of a bridge that we will use for VeChain:

### Project Details

We have been developing NFT Moon Metaverse for a year now . During this time, we have a large audience, as well as buyers of land, id cards, avatars. Currently, work is underway on the alpha version and the addition of new blockchains to the NFT Moon Metaverse.

#### Mockups/Designs of any UI components

It is an implementation of an online gaming web service based on three.js and blockchain, as well as distributed IOT infrastructure. The service provides users with access to the functionality as a result of authorization using a crypto wallet. Within the framework of the service, the user can use the functionality of systems designed for the processes of creating and editing content, market processes of exchange, purchase and sale and others, financial processes, management processes, learning processes, communication processes and game and non-game interaction of users with each other, as well as with the surrounding virtual world and objects of the surrounding virtual world.
The main mechanics of user-product interaction are create-to-earn and play-to-earn.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
